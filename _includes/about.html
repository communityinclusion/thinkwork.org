  <h4>Does All Mean All? Culturally Diverse Families and Access to Services
Wednesday December 9, 3pm - 3:44pm Eastern</h4>

<p>Join us for the next webinar in our "44" series! We'll be looking at how culturally diverse families access employment services for their family members with disabilities.</p>

<p>Researchers Judith Gross (University of Kansas) and Grace Francis (George Mason University) have worked intensively with Hispanic families in rural areas of Kansas. They will talk about the importance of engaging culturally and linguistically diverse families in services for their children with disabilities. They'll also discuss the barriers these families face, and offer strategies for professionals to help ensure full access to services.</p>

<p>We'll also hear from family members and individuals with disabilities about how culture and language impact their use of employment services.</p>

<p>This webinar is free and open to everyone. </p>
