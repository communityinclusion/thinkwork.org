<h3>Got 44 Minutes to Think About Employment?</h3>
 
<p>Reframe your mindset and get inspired with the RRTC’s webinar series, <em>“New Conversations About Integrated Employment.”</em></p>

<p>In 44 minutes, we’ll put a fresh spin on questions related to disability, careers, and community integration.</p>

<p><strong>(Why 44? Join us to find out!)</strong></p>

<p>It kicks off on <strong>Wednesday July 22, 3pm Eastern</strong>, with <em>“Employment Support Professionals: Leaders for Change.”</em></p>

<p>This conversation features Genni Sasnett, a human services consultant with extensive experience in disability and employment, and Jill Eastman, an award-winning employment specialist at the Institute for Community Inclusion.</p>
